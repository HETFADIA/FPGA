# Field Programming Gate Arrays(FPGA) in Verilog

## About the Project

The main objective of the project is to design a custom circuit using Logic tiles and Switch boxes.
We had to make 4 bit adder, Decoder and synchronous 8 bit shift register.

## FPGA

A FPGA(Field Programming Gate Arrays) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by the customer.
FPGA are used to make circuit.

## 4 bit full Adder

The addition of the two 4 bit numbers is done in two steps.
We use logic tiles to compute the bit 0 and bit 1 of the result.
